OpenConfig was designed to be pluggable from the start. Internally, OpenCong uses [http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/ Guice] for dependency injection. This allows hard-core developers to customize the internals of OpenConfig. In order to tell OpenConfig to use a custom implementation of an internal component, an open-config.properties must be created and dropped at the root level of the class-path.

The open-config.properties file is a key/value file where the key defines the component alias in question and the value being the implementation to be used. There are currently several pluggable components within OpenConfig which are explained below:

|| *Name* || *Default* ||
|| PropertyNormalizer || org.openconfig.core.bean.LowercasePropertyNormalizer||
|| OpenConfigContext ||  org.openconfig.core.BasicOpenConfigContext||
|| ConfiguratorFactory ||  org.openconfig.factory.impl.DefaultConfiguratorFactory||
|| EnvironmentResolver ||  org.openconfig.core.SystemPropertyEnvironmentResolver||
|| DataProvider ||  org.openconfig.providers.PropertiesDataProvider||
|| EventPublisher ||  org.openconfig.event.DefaultEventPublisher||
